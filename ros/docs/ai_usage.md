## AI Usage Disclosure

### Introduction
For this Module 3 Rosalind assignment, I collaborated with AI tools, specifically **OpenAI ChatGPT (GPT-5 mini)** and **Google Gemini 2.5**, to support my learning, generate code, and structure my workflow. The AI tools served as assistants for understanding bioinformatics concepts, creating Python scripts, debugging errors, and organizing the files and repository according to assignment requirements. AI was used as a **supportive resource**, not a replacement for my own understanding, problem-solving, or verification of the solutions.

### Purpose of AI Assistance
The main purpose of collaborating with AI was to accelerate learning and ensure that I could focus on understanding the bioinformatics problems and Python coding principles. The AI tools helped me in several areas:

1. **Code Generation:**  
   AI was used to generate initial templates for Python scripts corresponding to **Problems 1–9** from the Rosalind bioinformatics assignment. These scripts included reading input files, processing DNA and RNA sequences, performing calculations such as GC content, counting motifs, translating sequences into proteins, and outputting results. By providing a structured starting point, AI allowed me to focus on understanding the logic and mechanics behind each bioinformatics problem rather than struggling with syntax and boilerplate code.

2. **Error Analysis and Debugging:**  
   While running the generated scripts in **Google Colab**, I encountered several syntax errors, missing file errors, and Git-related push errors. AI assisted in diagnosing these issues, explaining the cause of the errors, and suggesting potential fixes. For example, AI explained the differences between `%bash` commands in Colab versus Python code, how to correctly structure input file paths, and how to configure Git for committing and pushing code from Google Drive. This guidance was crucial in helping me troubleshoot without losing focus on the learning objectives.

3. **Learning and Understanding Bioinformatics Concepts:**  
   Beyond code generation, AI was used to explain underlying bioinformatics concepts such as DNA transcription, RNA translation, GC content calculation, motif finding, and parsing FASTA files using Biopython. This helped reinforce my understanding of both the **problem requirements** and the **Python implementation**, enabling me to write or adjust code independently after reviewing AI suggestions.

4. **Workflow Organization:**  
   AI provided recommendations on folder structures and project organization, which is essential for version control and reproducibility. Based on AI suggestions, I created the following structure within my Google Drive:<br>
ros/<br>
├── src/ # Python scripts for Problems 1-9<br>
├── data/sample/ # Input files for the scripts<br>
├── docs/ # Documentation including AI usage<br>
├── outputs/ # Outputs from running scripts<br>
├── notebooks/ # Colab notebooks<br>
├── README.md # Project overview and personal info<br>
└── requirements.txt # Python dependencies<br>

This structure made it easier to manage files, run scripts in Colab, and push the project to GitHub in a clear and organized manner.

5. **Documentation Assistance:**  
AI was also used to draft **README.md** content and the **AI usage log**. The AI helped me write professional and concise documentation that clearly describes my workflow, the problems solved, and the responsible use of AI. By generating a structured draft, AI allowed me to focus on reviewing, refining, and verifying that all statements accurately reflect my own understanding and contribution.

### Verification and Independent Work
All AI-generated code, suggestions, and explanations were **carefully reviewed and verified by me**. After receiving suggestions:

1. I manually checked each script to ensure it met the requirements of the Rosalind problems.  
2. I tested each Python script in **Google Colab** to confirm that it produced the correct outputs for sample input files.  
3. I modified the AI-generated code as necessary to ensure readability, correctness, and adherence to Python best practices.  
4. I ensured that all file paths, input/output handling, and Biopython usage were consistent with the assignment instructions.  
5. Any conceptual guidance provided by AI was cross-checked against lecture materials and tutorials to confirm accuracy.

This verification process ensured that **every final script reflects my own understanding**, with AI assistance serving only as guidance and support rather than replacing my work.

### Responsible Use of AI
Throughout this assignment, I followed best practices for **responsible AI use**:

- AI was used to **suggest code and explain errors**, but I was actively involved in understanding the logic, writing parts of the code manually, and ensuring correctness.  
- AI was **not used to solve problems completely** without review; all outputs and logic were verified by me.  
- All AI interactions were **documented in `docs/ai_usage.md`**, ensuring transparency.  
- I adhered to academic integrity standards by crediting AI for its role in assisting with coding templates, explanations, and workflow suggestions.  

### Tools Used
The AI tools used in this assignment include:  
- **OpenAI ChatGPT (GPT-5 mini):** Assisted in code generation, error explanation, and workflow recommendations.  
- **Google Gemini 2.5:** Provided additional explanations and code suggestions to improve understanding of bioinformatics problems and Python implementation.

### Summary of AI Contribution
In summary, AI assisted me in the following ways:

1. **Providing code templates** for Rosalind problems 1–9.  
2. **Explaining errors and debugging** during script execution in Google Colab.  
3. **Teaching and reinforcing bioinformatics concepts** for better understanding of sequence analysis, transcription, translation, and motif counting.  
4. **Recommending project structure and organization** for reproducible and version-controlled workflows.  
5. **Drafting documentation** for README.md and AI usage logs.  

All suggestions and generated code were **reviewed, modified, and verified** by me to ensure that the final project represents my independent effort while demonstrating responsible collaboration with AI tools.

By using AI responsibly and documenting its contribution, I was able to **enhance my learning, improve workflow efficiency, and produce a high-quality submission** that meets the requirements of Module 3.
