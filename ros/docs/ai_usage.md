### Purpose of AI Collaboration
For this assignment, I collaborated with AI tools, specifically **OpenAI ChatGPT (GPT-5 mini)** and **Google Gemini**, to assist in understanding bioinformatics concepts, generating Python code templates, and explaining errors in code. The AI was used as a learning and productivity aid, not as a substitute for my own work.

### Specific Uses
- **Code generation:** Assisted in creating Python scripts for Problems 1–9, including reading input files, processing DNA/RNA sequences, and generating outputs.
- **Error debugging:** Provided explanations and suggested fixes for errors encountered while running Python scripts in Google Colab.
- **Workflow guidance:** Suggested folder structures, input file organization, and version-controlled workflow practices suitable for GitHub submission.
- **Documentation drafting:** Helped structure README.md content and AI usage logs to comply with assignment requirements.

### Verification and Testing
All AI-generated code and suggestions were:
1. **Reviewed manually** for correctness and understanding.
2. **Tested in Google Colab** to verify that outputs matched the expected Rosalind problem results.
3. **Refactored or modified** as necessary to ensure proper functionality and learning outcomes.

### Summary
AI tools were used **responsibly** to support my learning and to improve efficiency. I verified every solution, ensuring that the final code and documentation reflect my understanding and effort.

**AI Tools Used:**  
- OpenAI ChatGPT (GPT-5 mini)  
- Google Gemini 2.5
